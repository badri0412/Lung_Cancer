# Lung_Cancer
Deep learning models, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are promising for lung cancer detection and classification. Our study compares six CNN architectures—AlexNet, GoogleNet, VGG16, VGG19, LeNet, and ResNet—for automated lung cancer detection in CT scans. Using transfer learning, VGG19 achieved a high test accuracy of 94.8%.
